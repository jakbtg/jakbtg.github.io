    <h1>Hello I'm Jak</h1>
    <p>
      I just graduated in Articial Intelligence at the University of Turin, Italy.
      I obtained maximum grades and honors, and my thesis "<a
        href="http://lnx.pubblitesi.it/schede-sintetiche/area-scientifica/1640-giacomo-grandi-early-diagnosis-of-dementia-the-contribution-of-language-models-perplexity"
        target="_blank">Early Diagnosis of Dementia: The Contribution of Language Models' Perplexity</a>" received the
      Right of Publication.
      Together with the research team we are currently working on the publication of a
      paper on the topic.

    <h2>Bio</h2>
    <p>
      My name is Giacomo Grandi and I was born in Florence, Italy on
      february 27th, 1997. <br />
      I have always been an enthusiast traveler, I have visited 39
      countries around the world, and still counting. Except for
      Florence, I also lived in Palma de Mallorca (Spain), Turin
      (Italy), and Helsinki (Finland). <br />

    <br />
    <br />
    <p>
      I have also always been passionate about all kind of sports. My
      current favorites are cycling, climbing, skiing, and kayaking.
      You can find me on
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@wewild2220" target="_blank">WeWild</a>, a YouTube channel where me and my
      friends share our adventures. <br />
      Also, I am really into music, I have been playing the bass since
      I was 14. I had a band, <b>Beyond The Garden</b>, we released an
      album in 2016, check us on

    <p>Some selected projects I have been working on:</p>
    <h3>
      <a href="http://lnx.pubblitesi.it/schede-sintetiche/area-scientifica/1640-giacomo-grandi-early-diagnosis-of-dementia-the-contribution-of-language-models-perplexity"
        target="_blank">Early Diagnosis of Dementia: The Contribution of Language Models' Perplexity</a>
    </h3>
    <p>
      As part of my Master's thesis, I worked on a research project aimed at investigating whether language models
      can be employed to analyze language production and discriminate between subjects affected by mental disorders
      (across a broad spectrum, falling within the realm of dementia) and healthy subjects, using the perplexity metric.
      Results are very promising and we are currently working on the publication of a paper on the topic. The thesis has
      been published by PubbliTesi, the national database of the best theses from Italian universities.

    </h3>
    <p>
      Studying for the <b>Artificial Intelligence</b> course (University of Turin, Italy), I explored some symbolic
      approaches to AI. I implemented a <b>Prolog</b> program that gives the shortest route between two given stops of
      the Milan metro, an <b>ASP</b> program that returns a sporting championship calendar following some constraints, a
      <b>CLIPS</b> program that plays the Battleship game, and built an intelligent agent with the <b>SOAR</b> cognitive
      architecture that, via <b>Reinforcement Learning</b>, learns how to escape from a room.

    </h3>
    <p>
      Part of the projects for the <b>Natural Language Processing</b> course (University of Turin, Italy). I developed a
      rudimental chatbot that impersonates Professor Snape from the <b>Harry Potter</b> saga. The Professor Snape
      chatbot asks the user to answer some questions about potions and then it gives a score based on the answers.

        image classification via Convolutional Neural Networks</a>
    </h3>
    <p>
      Final project for the <b>Deep Learning</b> course (University of Helsinki, Finland). The goal of the project is to
      recognize several objects in an image. Since we can have more than one object in an image, we are dealing with a
      multiclassification and multilabel problem. Our approach is based on <b>Convolutional Neural Networks</b> as they
      are the state-of-the-art for image classification.

    <p>
      As final project for the <b>Game Poject Course</b> (University of Helsinki, Finland), me and my team developed a
      2D game on Unity. Our game Scarpetta is directly inspired by the game <b>Jetpack Joyride</b>. Basically it is an
      infinite running game where the player flies in order to avoid walls. If the player touches a wall it is Game
      Over. The gamer can collect coins to customize the character and pick up power-ups useful to survive longer. We
      worked on <b>Unity</b> making the game deployable on all platforms. We also published the game on the <b>Google
        Play Store</b>.

      As part of the <b>Mobile Devices Programming</b> course (University of Turin, Italy), me and my team developed a
      mobile application for Android, using <b>Kotlin</b> and <b>Android Studio</b>. The app is a social network where
      users can share their travel experiences linking pictures to the places they have visited. <br />
      The main page shows the map with small pins that represent the places where the user has been. By clicking on a
      pin, the user can see the pictures linked to that place.
